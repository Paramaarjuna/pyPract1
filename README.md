# Exercise 1. A Good First Program

## Code: ex1.py
```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun.")
print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')
```
## Output: ex1.py
```
$ python ex1.py
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
```

---

## Code: ex1_SD_1.py

```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun.")
print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print("Another line")
```

## Output: ex1_SD_1.py
```
$ python ex1_SD_1.py
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
Another line
```

---

## Code: ex1_SD_2.py

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

## Output: ex1_SD_2.py
```
$ python ex1_SD_1.py
Hello World!
```

---

## Code: ex1_SD_3.py

```python
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
print("This is fun.")
#print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print("Another line")
```

## Output: ex1_SD_3.py
```
$ python ex1_SD_1.py
Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
Another line
```

## Inference: ex1_SD_3.py
- When an Octothorpe(#) is placed at the beginning of the 4th line of the script, the statement in that line did not appear in the output.

# Exercise 2. Comments and Pound Characters

## Code: ex2.py
```python
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
```

## Output: ex2.py
```
$ python ex2.py
I could have code like this.
This will run.
